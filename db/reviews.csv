The walls are pretty thin so I can hear my suitemates talking through the walls even with the door closed.
The bathrooms aren't bad, the sinks look nice and the toilet has a environment friendly flush feature. The shower is a bit small, but at least there are two of them and there aren't too many conflicts with suitemates. Also, there aren't any active vents in the bathroom or shower. There is a vent that is more like just an opening, and doesn't move the air. The shower room has a window, but no other ventilation. The living room suite is actually pretty spacey and has a decent view.
My window is not tightly sealed so cold air comes in during the winter. But I do have control of the heating, which is pretty effective.
Room has glow in the dark stars on the ceiling :)",#thinwalls ,"The window isn't tightly sealed.
